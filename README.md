# Online Food Order Prediction üçΩÔ∏è

## Introduction
Online food ordering has rapidly transformed consumer behavior, making order prediction a key component for operational efficiency. This project applies machine learning techniques to forecast whether a user will place an online food order. It aims to help restaurants optimize inventory and personalize customer experiences.

## Project Overview
This project is built using classification algorithms to predict online food ordering behavior based on user demographics and lifestyle features. It analyzes patterns in historical data to generate reliable predictions. The model is trained, tested, and evaluated for accuracy and performance.

## Key Features
- Predicts likelihood of users placing an online food order.
- Provides insights into user behavior trends.
- Supports better business decision-making for food platforms.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Main programming language for implementing and training the model.
- Scikit-learn: Python library for machine learning that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn: Python libraries for data science, enabling efficient data manipulation, numerical computation, and insightful visualizations.

## Model Architecture
The system uses supervised learning with classification algorithms such as:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier

The model is selected based on evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset and Training
- Dataset Size: 400 records.
- Features include age, marital status, occupation, income, internet usage, etc.
- Data preprocessing: encoding, scaling, handling missing values.
- Split: 80% training, 20% testing.

## Results
- Achieved high prediction accuracy using Random Forest and Decision Tree models.
- Visualized correlation between internet usage, lifestyle, and ordering habits.
- Identified key features influencing online food order behavior.

## Future Work
- Integrate real-time data collection from user activity.
- Build a web-based interactive dashboard for restaurant analytics.
- Experiment with deep learning models and ensemble techniques for improved accuracy.
